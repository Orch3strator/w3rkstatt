**ToDO**: 
- [x] Initial Core Development
- [ ] Automate Control-M configuration 


**Configuration**: 
- After the inital run of w3rkstatt.py a local crypto key file is being generated in the /configs folder with [hostname].bin
- After the inital run of w3rkstatt.py a local config file is being generated in the /configs folder with [hostname].json
- Update the credentials and other settings in the [hostname].json file
- Execute w3rkstatt.py to encrypt the passwords in [hostname].json
- All password in cleartext will be removed
- Update file level access for [hostname].bin to only authorized OS accounts. If the file [hostname].bin is being deleted, the encrypted passwords cannot be recovered 
- The account running the python scripts needs to have access to [hostname].json and [hostname].bin
- Update ITSM Server settings

**Control-M**:
- Create Control-M account with proper permissions
- Add application credentials to [hostname].json
- Configure Control-M Alert notifications


## Module Information
**Control-M Configuration**: 
- Folder: ~/.w3rkstatt/configs
- File: [hostname].json - custome config file

## Control-M Alert Configuration
:one: &nbsp;Do not enable SNMP if you are not going to use it. 
:two: &nbsp;If any of the SNMP related parameters were changed in the CCM, make sure to cycle the Gateway(s) to make these changes take effect.
:three: &nbsp;Check the Gateway log files ($HOME/ctm_em/log/gtw_log*)

- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SNMPHost: Define the hostname of the SNMP server where the alerts are sent.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SNMPSendActive: Change the value to 1 to generate SNMP messages for Active Alerts.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SendSNMP: Change the value to 0 to send alerts to SNMP server only.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SendAlertNotesSnmp: Change the value to 1 if you want to send the NOTES field to the SNMP server.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XAlertsEnableSending: Change the value to 1 to enable xAlert sending.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XAlertsSnmpHosts: Define the hostname of the SNMP server where the xAlerts are sent.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XalertsSendSnmp: Change the value to 1 to send xAlerts to SNMP server only.

- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SendAlarmToScript: Define the full path name of the script that is activated when an alert is generated.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SendSNMP: Change the value to 1 to send alerts to a script only.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SendAlertNotesSnmp: Change the value to 1 if you want to send the NOTES field to a script.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;SNMPSendActive: Change the value to 1 to generate SNMP messages to a script.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XAlertsEnableSending: Change the value to 1 to enable xAlert sending.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XAlertsSend2Script: Define the full path name of the script that is activated when an xAlert is generated.
- :arrow_right: &nbsp;XalertsSendSnmp: Change the value to 2 to send xAlerts to a script only.

**Alert Configuration**
```bash
SendAlarmToScript: D:\Programs\BMCS\Integrations\ctm_alerts.bat
SendSNMP: 1
SendAlertNotesSnmp: 1
SNMPSendActive: 1
XAlertsEnableSending: 1
XAlertsSend2Script: D:\Programs\BMCS\Integrations\ctm_alerts.bat
XalertsSendSnmp: 2
```

**Alert Configuration Script**
Update ctm_alerts.bat or ctm_alerts.sh top point to the right script. 

**Alert Log Files**
Check the CTM EM gateway log file for details on script call and the .w3rkstatt\logs\[hostname].log for script execution information
